# Calculator Application in Python
------

## Objectives of project
- Get OOP experience in Python
  1. Figure out how Python differs from traditional OOP languages
  2. How does the class structure of a Python file works
  3. What is a class in Python, how does Python instance, static variable differ from other languages such as Java
  4. How does encapsulation, inheritence, abstractness and interfaces are applied in OO Python

- Unit testing in Python with 'unittest'
  1. How to setup and teardown a test such as paths to files
  2. Using logs to display output and debug
  3. Using data files to test a massive amount of data


- Using a Python Docker container to execute/debug python files
- Experience with Pycharm, from setting up configurations to debugging

## Project Deliverables 
### For this project, you need to create a calculator using Python that has automated unit tests.  
#### Your calculator is required to perform the following operations:
   - addition
   - subtraction
   - multiplication
   - division
   - square
   - square root

#### You need to correctly use static methods, object methods, object attributes/properties. You need to use the included files to load data for your unit tests. Use each file to test the associated operation.
